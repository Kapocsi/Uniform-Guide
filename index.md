## Maintenance/Setup Guides

<details markdown="1"><summary>Boots</summary>

1. If you have excessive boot cancer or have new boots with wax, you need to strip them. Stripping is done by placing the boot under hot water and then scrubbing with a horsehair brush or toothbrush until the polish is removed; to check if the polish is removed, stretch the boot with your nail. If any material comes off, then continue curbing. If not your done with step 1
2. Use a horse Hair Brush and gently remove dust from the boot, be sure to clean any boot cancer off.
3. Polish Welts, take a toothbrush and dip it in your polish. Go around the welts and apply a little bit of polish to blacken them.
4. Apply a base coat, wrap the polishing cloth over your finger and ensure there are no wrinkles beneath, dip your finger into some water, apply a large about of polish but do not rub it in, and make sure the application is smooth but the surface should be a matt grey/black. Let the boot rest for 5-10 minutes. Take a horsehair brush and buff the layer. The layer should begin to have a sheen. 
    1. To add extra base layers, take a sizeable amount of polish, apply it to the b oot, then buff with horsehair
5. Polishing layer, apply minimal polish to your cloth in the same method as previously detailed (see step 4), but this time with more water. You can also add some water to the polish on your finger. In small circles, go around the desired area; your boot will first go dull, and then, as the polish is applied, you will begin to see the boot shine. Repeat this step until you achieve a good finish.
#### Note : for regular polishing, use steps 1 and 5. If the boot has endured damage or heavy wear, repeat step 4.1.
#### Definitions
- Base Layer: A thick layer of polish to be applied to fixture significant imperfections in the boot, applied in a thick layer and buffed with horsehair; use more polish than water
- Polishing Layer: A thin coat is used to fix minor imperfections; you should use more water than polish. Materials Needed: Kiwi Polishing Kit check Walmart they usually stock them

- Place the beret on your head, step into your shower, align the badge with the center of your left eye, and hook your thumb beneath it; turn on the shower and shape the beret by pulling to the right and smoothing the top.
